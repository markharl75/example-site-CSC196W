    <h1>Chon for Beginners</h1>
    <p><strong>Chon</strong> is a progressive metal band that was originally formed in <em>2008</em>. Since then, they have become massively popular 
        among guitar players, mainly because of their extremely difficult & unique playing style. Overall, I consider Chon to be a good 
        entry-level band for those who want to learn or listen to more metal music. You can find a link to one of their songs
